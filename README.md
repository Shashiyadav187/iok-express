# iok-express

### a IoT platform based on expressjs, passportjs, mosca and mongodb.

In simple words the purpose of any IoT device is to connect with other IoT devices and applications (cloud-based mostly) to relay information using internet transfer protocols.[http://internetofthingswiki.com]

The gap between the device sensors and data networks is filled by an IoT Platform. Such a platform connects the data network to the sensor arrangement and provides insights using backend applications to make sense of plethora of data generated by hundreds of sensors.

In light of the possibilities that internet of things is offering tech companies has started capitalizing it. There are many IoT platforms available now that provide option to deploy internet of things applications on the go. this is a try to have your own IoT platform.


## Steps to run locally

firstly besure Mongodb is running on localhost:27017
for Mongodb installation refer to [https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/]
Then, in a new terminal window, start the MongoDB daemon to start mongodb server;
```
$ sudo mongod
```


in new terminal window, download and install iok-express git;
```
$ git clone https://github.com/iokloud/iok-express/

$ cd iok-express

$ npm install

$ npm start
```


## IOK-Express API
The Thing API defines a set of services to create, update or control any things. 

```
POST /signup
POST /signin
POST /thing
GET /thing
GET /thing/:clientid
PUT /thing/:clientid
DELETE /thing/:clientid
```

test our secure REST API using <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/launching_postman/installation_and_updates">Postman</a> REST Client or Curl command. You can install Postman for Chrome extension.
Now, open Postman then enters method, address (http://localhost:3000/api/signup) and body parameters for create or signup new user. After click Send button and successfully created a new user, you should see this message.

Next, we have to test if REST API for Thing resource is restricted for the authorized user only. Change method to "GET" and API endpoint to "http://localhost:3000/api/thing" then click Send button. You should see this message on the Postman result.

```
Unauthorized
```

To access the Thing resource, we have to log in using previously registered user. Change method to "POST" and endpoint to "http://localhost:3000/api/signin" then fill credentials like below screenshot.
If a login is successful, we should get a JWT token like below.

Just copy and paste the token value for use in request headers of restricted Thing resource. Now, do previous get Thing and add this header.

If you see the blank array in response, then you are authorized to use Thing resources because we have not created any thing. Now, you can do the same thing for posting new Thing.

for invoking list of created things as locally;
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/thing/
```
